This Task Management App is built to streamline task handling within teams. It has three user roles:

Admin: Holds full access to all endpoints. Admin can manage users, assign tasks, and oversee all aspects of the system.
Manager: Has permissions to manage tasks and view user profiles within their team, enabling efficient team coordination.
User: Can manage their own tasks and view their profile, promoting personal accountability and task tracking.
The app leverages Node.js and MongoDB for backend functionality and ensures smooth, role-based access control, making it suitable for organizations of varying sizes.
